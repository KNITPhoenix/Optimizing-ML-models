# Optimizing-ML-models

# The project implements the following points for ML models:

- train and evaluate models using both the two-way holdout method, and an 
evaluation approach appropriate for models with hyperparameters that uses k-fold cross 
validation plus a test set.

- optimize a machine learning model. In particular, using gradient descent to optimize a 
logistic regression model.

- Perform optimization with a different algorithm (Newton-Raphson)
